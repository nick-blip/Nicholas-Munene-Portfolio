# Setup Chunk

In this markdown I will be creating a model that analyses data fro the
breast cancer dataset by following the stages of data analysis. We start
by installing all the required packages We start by installing all the
required packages

``` r
if (require("languageserver")) {
  require("languageserver")
} else {
  install.packages("languageserver", dependencies = TRUE,
