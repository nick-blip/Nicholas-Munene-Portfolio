 Welcome to my professional portfolio. This document serves as a comprehensive overview of my academic journey and the skills I have acquired along the way.

Data Analysis Highlights

Contained within this portfolio is a series of R Markdown files (.rmd) that meticulously outline the various stages of data analysis. These documents include a detailed data analysis model that focuses on prediction and accuracy indicators. Please note that any warnings highlighted in the data_analysis_breakdown.md file can be disregarded, as the final visualizations are presented at the end of the second chunk.
